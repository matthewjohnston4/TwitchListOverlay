// Fill in your twitchUser and rename this file to config-local.js

// When someone initiate commands, you can optionally enable this overlay to notify that
// person whenever there's something incorrect about their use of the command.
// For example, if they try to remove an item, and the command was invalid, they'll know about it
// rather than it just failing silently.
// To use this error notification functionality, you'll need a Twitch account that you want to
// authorize for API use. You can use your main Twitch account, but messages will appear to come
// from it. Or you can create an alternate account with a Bot-like username. It's up to you.
// Whatever account you choose, goto https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ while logged in and click "Connect"
// Then paste the entire `oauth:abcdefhgihihjisdsa` string into 'password' below.
// `botUsername` should be the Twitch username of whatever account you want to use for replies.

// If you don't want to use chat reply, just leave the values blank.
