# TwitchListOverlay

A simple OBS overlay to allow a Twitch channel's broadcaster or mods to add a titled list of items to their stream, via Twitch chat commands or an OBS broadcast dock.

Ideal for objective lists, todo lists, schedules or whatever else comes in list form.

This overlay includes use of local browser storage — lists are saved and can be re-used on subsequent streams on the same channel.

## Installation

If you want to use this overlay, you'll need OBS or similar and be comfortable editing a settings file for configuration.

1. Download the ZIP archive of [the latest stable release](https://github.com/matthewjohnston4/TwitchListOverlay/releases) and extract to your local machine or just clone this repo.
2. In the extracted files, rename `config-local.js.sample` to `config-local.js`.
3. Fill in `twitchUser` in `config-local.js` with your Twitch channel username.
4. _Optional_ Fill in `password` and `botUsername` in `config-local.js` to enable chat-based errors for command users (see the comments in `config-local.js.sample` for a longer explanation).
4. Open OBS or whatever you're using, and add `twitchOverlays.html` as a Browser Source. Set `height` and `width` to the same dimensions as the resolution of your stream.
5. _Optional:_ Enable "Shutdown source when not visible" to reload the overlay when you toggle its visibility — this is useful if you're making adjustments to the CSS or color variables.
6. Position the overlay by dragging it to your preferred vertical location within OBS. Check out the `fillDirection` setting below for more on how you can customise how the overlay will expand vertically.
7. _Optional:_ Enable an broadcaster-only admin mode OBS dock view as shown below.

You're done! Now you can test this out by typing `!list:new Hello, World!` in your Twitch channel chat.

## Usage

All these subcommands can vary based on the value of `commandNameBase` in `config-general.js`:

### List and title commands:

* **Creating a new list:**
   `!list:new <title>` creates a new list with the specified title. Overwrites any stored list.
* **Deleting and hiding the list:**
   `!list:delete` deletes all content from the overlay and hides it — you may want to just hide it with `!list:hide` as below.
* **Hiding the overlay:**
   `!list:hide` hides the overlay, but retains all of the entered items and titles. Useful if you want to come back to the same list later in a stream.
* **Showing the overlay:**
   `!list:show` shows the overlay, if it was previously hidden, with any previous values for title and items retained.
* **Changing list title:**
   `!list:title <title>` sets a new title for the list using the specified text.

### Item commands:

* **Adding a new item:**
   `!list:add <text>` adds an item to the list with the specified text.
* **Marking an item as complete:**
   `!list:complete <itemNumber>` completes an item using its numbered position in the list (just count its position, this is not 0-indexed like an array).
* **Removing a specific item:**
   `!list:remove <identifier>` removes an item from the list, by specifying some identifier. The default identifier is to type the exact string of text of the item you want to remove, but you can customise this as shown below (in "Handler Options").
* **Removing all items without hiding list:**
   `!list:clear` or `!list:empty` empties a list of all items, while keeping the title and leaving the overlay active.

### Advanced commands

* `!list:removeIndex <itemNumber>` removes an item from the list, by specifying a 1-based index.
* `!list:addSilent <text>` adds an item to the list with the specified text, but doesn't 'show' the overlay if it is hidden.

**Some notes about usage:** the list of items, and the title, are stored locally by your browser, and _will not clear_ by themselves. This can be very useful, if you want to retain a list over multiple streams, but if you can't remember whether you had a previous list, and want to start afresh, remember to use `!list:new` instead of `add` or `show`.


## Admin mode OBS dock

This overlay can be put into a special admin mode which allows editing of the list items and status directly in a browser. If you're using OBS, you can use this admin mode in a custom browser dock, which means it'll be visible and usable only by you.

To enable this admin mode dock:
1. Open `twitchOverlays.html` in a web browser, and copy the "URL" of the file location (ie. the address that starts `file://`).
2. Open OBS
3. Click the 'View' menu and select Docks > Custom Browser Docks...
4. Add the copied URL from step 1 as a Dock URL, and append `?admin` to the URL. For example:

    ```
    file:///Users/matthewjohnston4/TwitchTodoOverlay/twitchOverlays.htm?admin
    ```
5. Click `Apply` then `Close`

You should now have a resizeable dock window like this:

There are controls here for showing/hiding the list, clearing it, removing or completing items, and adding new items. You can also rename the title or the text of existing items by just clicking on them (they're in a disguised input box) and editing them with your keyboard.

**NOTE** that unlike with the chat commands, edits to titles or item text will be shown in real-time. So you might still prefer to use the chat commands.

## Customising

There are a few common settings to edit in `config-general.js` in order to adjust how the overlay looks and sounds:

* `commandNameBase`: The base command name that all the subcommands are derived from
* `handlerOptions`:
    * `removalMethod`: Determines how users use the `:remove` command, [see below](#remove-methods) for more details. One of "fullText", "startsWithText", or "index".
    * `removalDebounce`: How many seconds to wait between allowing `index`-based `:remove` commands.
    * `useListSymbols`: Change this setting if you want to enable or disable the display of list item bullets.
    * `listSymbol`: Adjust to modify what symbol gets used as the 'bullet'. You can use any unicode symbol (https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/) or standard emoji (not Twitch emotes).
* `position`:
    * `horizontal`: Where to put the list item within the entire overlay bounds. One of `left`, `right`, or `middle`. You can also ignore this setting and drag the position of the overlay in OBS, but if you want to quickly flip the list from one side of the stream to another, this setting will help you do that.
    * `fillMethod`: Determines how the list will expand as you add items. You can still position your overlay manually by dragging it in OBS, but the `fillMethod` will ensure your list will expand in the right direction for where you place it.
        * `fromCentre` means the height will expand vertically in equal amounts for each added items.
        * `downwards` means the height will always expand downwards.
        * `upwards` means the height will always expand upwards.
    * `hMargin`: Horizontal margins around the list (include CSS units). Margins are useful if you want to snap the overlay, but still have a gap from the edge of your stream video.
    * `vMargin`: Vertical margins around list (include CSS units).
    * `padding`: Padding inside the list, around the content (include CSS units).
    * `width`: Width that the list should fill within the overlay bounds. Can be a static value like `400px` or a proportional one like `25vw`.
* `font`:
    * `baseSize`: Base font size. Include a CSS unit.
    * `titleSize`: Title font size. Include a CSS unit.
    * `textAlign`: One of `left` or `right`
    * `family`: A valid font-family string.
* `colors`:
    * `foreground`: RGB value of the text and line colors within the list.
    * `foregroundOpacity`: Decimal value (to one place) between 0 and 1.0 of the opacity of the text.
    * `background`: RGB value of the background of the list.
    * `backgroundOpacity`: Decimal value (to one place) between 0 and 1.0 of the opacity of the background of the list.
* `style`:
    * `rounded`: Set a px value for rounded corners of the overlay
* `twitchEmotes`: Set to false to leave emote text as text, true to try and convert it to an image (GIFs do not work yet).
* `sounds`: All sound options can be left as a blank string (`""`) if you don't want any sounds to play.
    * `activate`: Sound that plays when the commands `:new` or `:show` are used.
    * `newItem`: Sound that plays when an item is added to the list using `:add`.
    * `completeItem`: Sound that plays when an item is completed using `:complete` (does not play for `:remove` commands).

You can also replace the sound files in `assets/sounds` with your own files to customise the alert sounds.

### Custom CSS

If you want to customise further, please add a file in `assets/styles_extra.css` and add CSS rules to it. This file is included in the `.gitignore`, so it will not be overwritten when you want to upgrade your version of the overlay.

### Removal methods

The `removalMethod` setting determines how the `:remove` subcommand works:

* `fullText` - anyone using the command will need to type the exact text of an item to remove it.
* `startsWithText` - a best attempt will be made to pick an item that starts with the string used. If more than one item matches, none will be removed and an error message will be sent back to the command user.
* `index` - uses a one-based index (ie. starts from 1) to identify the item to remove. When this setting is used, `removalDebounce` is active - this disables additional use of the `:remove` command for a number of seconds. This can be useful to prevent collisions between multiple users calling the same command, but using `index` is still riskier.

## Upgrading

To upgrade, you can backup your `styles_extra.css`, `config-general.js`, and `config-local.js` files, delete the overlay directory, and then re-download. Copy relevant configuration settings back in again afterwards. And make sure OBS has refreshed your updates.

After you have updated, I recommend testing the overlay a while yourself, and make sure that it all works as expected. I run a bunch of manual tests before putting up new versions of the overlay, but can't give it quite as much of a test as a live stream will provide.

## ADVANCED: Making custom handles and modifying the `src/app.tsx` source

If you want to add your own handlers, you will need to understand TypeScript, React, and the tmi.js library. We'll also use Babel, but you don't really need to understand what it does (processes React's JSX format into plain, browser-compatible JavaScript), as I've included the necessary steps below in "Preprocessing after making code changes".

There are a few extra things to consider.
1. Do you want it to fire based on a !command?
2. Do you want it to fire on every chat?
3. What security should prevent the handler being fired? e.g mod only, broadcaster only etc.
4. What should the handler do?

Once you have answered those questions you are ready to add the handler.

1. Navigate to `src/app.tsx`
2. Add a new entry to the `actionHandlers` constant using this format:
``` javascript
":subcommand": {
    security: (context: ChatUserstate, textContent: string) => {
        return true; // This should return a boolean, true will fire the handler
    },
    handle: (context: ChatUserstate, textContent: string) => {
        // Place handle script here
        // If you want to send a message response in-channel, your handler should return
        // the message as a string. If not, you can leave it as a void function.
    }
}
```
3. Complete your handler and don't forget to add a description to this README.

`src/app.js` and `src/helpers.js` contain a few handy functions that you can reuse in your custom handlers.

## Preprocessing after making code changes

After you've made changes to any `src/*` files, you'll need to re-preprocess them into compatible browser JavaScript using Webpack and Babel. It's pretty simple, if you have Node (v12.13.0 was used to create this) and NPM (v6.13.4) installed:

1. Run `npm i` from the project root. This will install a whole bunch of development pre-requisites, including Webpack, Babel, and some other plugins for those. You shouldn't need to configure anything, however.
2. Run `npm run build`. This will run the TypeScript typechecker and an ESLint linter.

You can also use `npm run watch` which will launch an auto-watcher which will look for changes in `src/` and process them into `bin/` where `twitchOverlays.htm` expects them to be.
